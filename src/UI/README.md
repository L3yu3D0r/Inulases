# Tauri + Preact + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, Preact and Typescript in Rsbuild. Rsbuild is a bit faster than vite so might be worth it for larger applications or places you want to get the most performance.

## Setup
First you need to clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alfredoes234/tauri-preact-rsbuild-template.git
```
Then you can use your respective package manager
```bash
npm install
```
Then run the application
```bash
npm tauri dev
```
This will launch the desktop app and can be used in browser for easier use by removing tauri and using run instead

### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
